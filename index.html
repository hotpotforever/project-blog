        <h2 id="vaccination-diary">Vaccination diary</h2>
        
        <p>I had my vaccination yesterday at the stadium. I was such a blessing to have the opportunity to get vaccinated in the midst of the pandemic like this, especially when things are becoming more and more serious. I feel safe.</p>
        
        <p>Coming to the vaccination place, you need to have some <strong>documents related to your personal information, and a health declaration with a confirmation that you agree to take the vaccine completely by your own will.</strong><br>
        There will be a notification text sent to your phone through sms and you would need to <strong>show the staffs at the vaccination place that text as prove that you are on the list for vaccination.</strong><br>
        After entering the stadium, you will get your blood pressure test and some general question about any medication you are taking or if you are pregnant or not. Once everything is done you're good to proceed to the injection area.<br> 
        The injection was not too painfull to me, it will stings a bit and the area where you get the injection will throb. Bare in mind everyone will have a different experience with the side effect.
        </p>
        
        <p><em>Here are what I'm feeling so far, after roughly 20 hours of vaccination:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drowsiness.</li>
            <li>My body feels sore.</li> 
            <li>The area of injection hurts but bareable.</li>
            <li>I don't have a fever.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>That's all I have for you. If you want more, let me know in the comment section!</p>

        <h2 id="about-meme">Let's talk about meme.</h2>
        
        <p>You might not know this (or maybe you have heard of it somewhere from someone idk lol) but I have a liking for meme <strong><em>especially cat meme.</em></strong><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRhWSuoV5RUZiv4vizlSTEFOJCuA6Db5nwvtA&usqp=CAU" height="100"></p>
        
        <p>If you don't know what meme is, worry no more, I am here to satify your curiousity. <img src="https://static.stacker.com/s3fs-public/styles/sar_screen_maximum_large/s3/2019-03/Screen%20Shot%202019-03-14%20at%2010.49.01%20AM.png" height="100"></p>
        
        <p>Now if you just try to google: <em>what is meme</em>, you will have this result:<br> 
        <em>"meme (n) is an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means, especially imitation."</em></p>
        
        <p>That's how ordinary people define meme, but we are cool people from <em><strong>gen Z</strong></em>, we like to think of meme as a form of <em>art</em> <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-01/23/12/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/sub-buzz-28390-1548266319-1.jpg?crop=400%3A393%3B0%2C3&resize=475%3A%2A" height="100"> it's the type of art that add spices to our plain daily life.</p>
        
        <p>A meme normally portraits a message and we use it in our conversation very often, meme makes our convos have a higher level of entertainment, Millenials like to use emoji but I say that era has passed my friends, <em><strong>meme is the new emoji.</strong></em></p>
        
        <p>Over the decades, many have been arguing about the correct pronunciation of the word, if you want to look like an intellectual, it's time to learn how to pronounce this word.<br>
        <em><strong>Meme</strong></em> is pronounced <strong><em>/mÄ“m/</em></strong> not /mimi/ or /meme/. So next time when someone ask you if you know any good "mimi", stoke them with the correct pronunciation <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/a57bec1b-f381-4229-b54c-555c904ce3d2" height="100">.</p>
        
        <p>Now that you have an idea of what meme is, it's time to introduce you to <em><strong>some of the most famous meme on the internet.</strong></em></p>
